# Lab 04: Dissecting the Domain Name System (DNS)

## Overview
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of computer networks. In this lab, youâ€™ll examine how DNS works by inspecting the DNS records for domains you (likely) use every day.

### Learning objectives
After completing this lab, you should be able to:
* Use `dig` to send and receive DNS queries and responses
* Use `tshark` to capture and inspect network packets
* Determine the addresses and/or aliases associated with a domain name (DN)
* Explain the steps required to obtain addresses and/or aliases for a DN
* Conduct simple network measurements involving DNS


## Getting started
Clone your git repository on a tigers server.

As you work on this lab, you may want to refer to the [class notes on DNS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hw4gsG142lPyKLFF1DLgr0A0x021FhWIcpkmW1yUU1k/edit?usp=sharing).

You will need **three** terminal windows. You will run the following three commands (one in each terminal window) in the order listed below:

1. **`./docker_bind.sh BIND_PORT`** 

    replacing `BIND_PORT` with a randomly choosen port number between `5000` and `65000`; this will determine the port on which `bind`â€”a popular DNS application that functions as both a name server (NS) and a recursive resolver (RR)â€”listens for DNS queries.

2. **`./docker_exec.sh tshark -Odns udp and port 53 > packets.txt`**

    The command line arguments do the following:
        * `tshark` is the program to run within the Docker container
        * `-Odns` tells tshark to print out detailed information about the contents of DNS queries/responses
        * `udp and port 53` is a filter that tells tshark to only capture and analyze packets whose transport-layer protocol is the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and whose source or destination port is 53 (the standard port for DNS) 
        * `> packets.txt` instructs the terminal to store the output from tshark into a file called `packets.txt`

3. **`dig @127.0.0.1 -p BIND_PORT +notcp www.colgate.edu A`**

    replacing `BIND_PORT` with the same value you used above. This command runs `dig` to issue a DNS query to `bind` for `A` records for [www.colgate.edu](www.colgate.edu). The command line arguments do the following:
        * `@127.0.0.1` tells dig to contact the RR running on the local machine (in a Docker container)
        * `-p BIND_PORT` tells dig to contact the RR on port `BIND_PORT`
        * `+notcp` tells dig to use UDP, instead of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as the transport-layer protocol
        * `www.colgate.edu` is the domain name whose records are requested
        * `A` is the type of DNS records requested

**ðŸ›‘ Answer the Getting Started questions in `questions.md`**

## Part 1: Record types
Your first task is to explore the different records associated with popular domains. You **only** need to run `bind` and `dig` for this part of the lab; you **do not** need to run `tshark`. Furthermore, you only need to start `bind` once, and let it continue to run until you are done with this part of the lab.

### Dig output
When you run `dig`, it provides lots of information about the DNS query and response. Below is a sample output from issuing a query for `A` records for `portal.colgate.edu`: 
```
; <<>> DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu &lt;<>> @localhost -p 8053 +notcp portal.colgate.edu A

```

The most pertinent parts of `dig`â€™s output are:
* **Question** section: This lists the domain name (DN) and record type for which a query was issued.
* **Answer** section: This lists the DNS records that matched the query. If this section is missing from the output, then no DNS records matched the query.
* **Authority** section: This lists the Name Servers (NS) that are the authoritative name servers for the DN, from whom the answer originated.

## Part 2: Recursive resolvers
Your second task is to learn how DNS RRs work. As you work on this part of the lab, you must **restart bind at as instructed** to ensure you properly observe `bind`â€™s behavior.**

**Take the following actions now:**
1. Restart bind
2. Wait until bind outputs `running` 
3. Run `tshark`, using the redirection operator (`>`) to store its output in a file
4. Issue a DNS query for `A` records for `www.colgate.edu`
5. Kill `tshark` (using `Ctrl+c`)

### Tshark output
When you run `tshark` with the `-Odns` command-line argument, `tshark` provides lots of information about DNS queries and responses. Below is a sample of `tshark`â€™s output for the 3rd and 5th packets sent/received by `bind`.

The 3rd packet is a DNS query for A records for www.colgate.edu. The query originated from a Docker containerâ€”Docker is configured to use IP addresses starting with `172.17.0`, except for `172.17.0.1`, which refers to the host operating systemâ€”and is destined for the NS whose IP address is `192.203.230.10`.

The 5th packet is a DNS response. The response originated from the NS whose IP address is `192.203.230.10` and is destined for a Docker container. The response contains the DNs of the NSes responsible for the root DNS zone.

### Reverse lookup
Although DNS is primarily used to lookup IP addresses and DN aliases associated with DNs, it is also capable of doing a reverse lookup: i.e., lookup the DN associated with an IP addressed.  To conduct a reverse lookup, include the `-x` command-line argument in the call to dig and specify `PTR` as the record type. For example:
```
	dig @localhost -p BIND_PORT +notcp -x 192.55.83.30 PTR
```
(Remember to **substitute** the port you used for `bind for `BIND_PORT`.)


**ðŸ›‘ Answer the Part 2 questions in `questions.md`. You must restart `bind` when instructed to ensure you properly observe bind's behavior.**

## Self-assessment
The self-assessment for this lab will be available on Moodle next week. Please complete the self-assessment by 11pm on Tuesday, February 20.
